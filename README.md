# Sudoku-Solver-Basic

## Current Architectural Ideas:
Board will contain all of the functionality of the board \
- Stores elements in a map where the key is the string combination of the row and column; row values go from A - I and column values go from 1 - 9.


### Todo's:
1. Sort out the map in Board.java so that the strings are labelled appropriately (ie A1)
2. Merge Board and SudokuBoard as their responsibilities are too common. OR Actually split responsibilities.
